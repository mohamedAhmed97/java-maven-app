## Introduction

This project aims to streamline the deployment process of a Maven-based Java application through a DevOps pipeline. It leverages several tools and technologies to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Docker: Install Docker to build and manage containers.
- Jenkins: Set up Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- Ansible: Install Ansible for configuring servers.
- Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., EKS, Minikube) to deploy your application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

1. **Dockerfile**: Dockerfile for building Docker images.

2. **Jenkinsfile**: File for CI/CD pipelines, which build Docker images, push them to Docker Hub, and update Ansible inventory.

3. **ansible/**: Holds Ansible playbooks and configurations for server setup and application deployment.

4. **k8s/**: Contains Kubernetes deployment files for deploying your application in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use this DevOps project:

1. **Building Docker Images**: Navigate to the `Dockerfile` directory and use the Dockerfiles to build Docker images for your application.

2. **Jenkins CI/CD**: Configure Jenkins with your project's CI/CD pipeline defined in the `Jenkinsfile` directory. Jenkins will build, test, and push Docker images to Docker Hub.

3. **Ansible Deployment**: Use the Ansible playbooks in the `ansible/` directory to configure your servers and deploy the application. Update the inventory files with the correct server details.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy your application to a Kubernetes cluster by applying the Kubernetes YAML files in the `k8s/` directory.
